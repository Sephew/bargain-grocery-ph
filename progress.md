2/18/2026 - Transitioned from Sentiment Analytics Stock trader to Price Watch Grocery Ingredients Recommendation System. Because it's practical and can help me practice multiple backend disciplines

2/19/2026 - Created file structures & listed the requirements needed, did simple webscraping tests with requests & beautifulsoup4

2/20/2026 - Understood AJAX & Jquery, tried to look for AJAX requests we can use, or hidden APIs to no success. Concluded the best scenario is to look for <table> and iterate for each tr then tc to get the <a> link of the pdf
Next Step: Iterate through <tables> get the anchor links, open PDFs (test with 1), build backend sql for data storage then CSV read using Tesseract then write it down to DB.
Mistakes Made: Spent time trying different methods to find hidden APIs or requests for simpler implementation, however it seems like the data does not call from a backend because no XHR or fetch requests where made. Most likely, files are stored directly to wordpress.

NOTE: If you will experiment, use ipynb to document exploration.


2/21/2026 - I did not push my commit from my desktop, so now I have to redo progress from yesterday. This should be easy because I now know how to do it, all I need to do is recollect the process from memory.
